# I Hate Microsoft

I Hate Microsoft (or IHM for short) is a fast application that lets you prevent Windows from sending information about you, and your activity to Microsoft, Disable Cortana, and Disable Bloat in a matter of seconds.

Note: Your Antivirus may flag the software as Malware since it modifies files within the `Windows` folder.

# Roadmap

I plan to update this software with options to do much more in the future regarding Optimization, Privacy, and just useful features in general.
